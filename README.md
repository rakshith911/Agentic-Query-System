This is built for the purpose of Technical Assessment from CanyonCode.

I am building an agentic query system with the following technical requirements:
1. Develop an agentic query application that answers natural language questions about camera feeds, encoders, and decoders
2. Build 1. using LangGraph for agentic workflow orchestration
3. Build 2. by converting all data operations into MCP tools (data retrieval, filtering, analysis methods)
4. Develop an equivalent implementation of 3. using code-gen IDE (Cursor, Replit, or similar)

I am yet to write an evaluation script to verify the results and will update it when done.
