    "query": "3. What is the average frame rate in the Pacific region?",
    "answer": "In the Pacific region, there are three data points related to frame rates:\n\n1. A frame rate of **15.0 fps**\n2. A frame rate of **29.97 fps**\n3. Another frame rate of **29.97 fps**\n\nTo find the average frame rate, we add these values together and divide by the number of data points:\n\n- Total frame rates = 15.0 + 29.97 + 29.97 = **74.94 fps**\n- Number of frame rates = 3\n\nNow, calculating the average:\n\nAverage frame rate = Total frame rates / Number of frame rates = 74.94 / 3 \u2248 **24.98 fps**\n\nSo, the average frame rate in the Pacific region is approximately **25.0 fps**."
